QUICKSORT

The quick-sort algorithm is one of the more efficient forms of sorting. This method
takes numbers and sorts them by breaking them down based off one of the
numbers of your choosing. Let's use these numbers and get started 8,7,3,6,9.

Quicksort uses what's called a pivot number, basically any number of your choosing
from our array, to make it easy let's just use the number on the left. Once we choose
our pivot number we sort the rest of the number from left to right into new arrays
based off of that pivot point. Our two new array are 7,3,6 and 9 with our old array
of 8 still existing in the middle. Then we repeat the process with a new pivot for
each new array until the array is sorted.

Psuedo-code
Quicks-sort:
quickSort(array){
  pivot[]
  left[]
  right[]
(make loop comparing to pivot)
  if (less then pivot ){
    sort left
  }else{
    sort right
}
}


Best case scenario: If pivot is in the middle.	O(n log(n))

Worst case: If pivot is one of the higher numbers or the lower.
	O(n2)
