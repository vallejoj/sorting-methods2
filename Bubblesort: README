Welcome to the wild world of sorting, where you take things...and sort them!

Sorting is an ancient art used since the beginning of time, 1951. With one of the
most earliest sorting algorithms the bubble sort.

Bubble sorting a simple yet pretty inefficient sorting method but
really fun to bare witness to.

Let's take a look at these numbers to show how bubble sorting works 8,7,3,6,9.

The sorting begins is an inefficient, simple and repetitive sorting method that starts
with the first number and compares it to the number next to it. If the second number is
lower then the first number the numbers switch, 7,8,3,6,9. Then we compare our initial first
number with the next and switch them if the next number is lower 7,3,8,6,9 and we do this till that first initial number finds its place and then we repeat again with the first number in the line until our numbers are completely sorted.

Pseudo-code

bubbleSort(array)
(create two loops one to control the second loop){
(second loop to go thru numbers){
if statement(1st number bigger then 2nd number then swap)
temp variable= 1st number
1st number=2nd number
2nd number = temp
}
}

Best case scenario: If numbers are sorted in order. O(n)
Worst case: If numbers are unsorted and there are high numbers in the start and
low numbers at the end of an array and it is a large array. O(n2)
